# Spotify_Analysis app and papers

This project has been done at UC Berkeley as part of the course IEOR 135: "Applied Data Science with Venture Application". 
By exploiting musical features like rythm, pitch and the timbre vectors of a song, its success is predicted in different regions of the world. 
The model is trained using a set of 72,291 unique songs scraped from Spotify.
